Reverie is a unique 2D platformer with gesture based gameplay. Draw shapes, defeat enemies and help the little girl escape.Use 'A' ,'D' and 'Space' to move around. Use mouse to draw.

### The game has following technical features :

* Full player FSM
* Messenger pattern to decouple modules

Made this game as part of my college project. The inital prototype was developed as part of a Game Jam where the theme was 'Childhood'. But as I am currently employed I don't have time to continue development on this game.
